# Attribution
The principles here for project structure follow the architectural patterns recommended by google in
their ![Now in Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid/ "Now in Android") sample.
Additionally we follow learnings from ![Jendrik Johannes](https://github.com/jjohannes "Jendrik Johannes") for modern Gradle conventions.

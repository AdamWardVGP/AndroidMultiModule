Multi-Module project template
==============================

This project is meant to be a minimal starting point for a multi-module gradle build setup, with
utility gradle plugins, versions catalog and a few dependencies already packaged to have a quick
start for building new projects.

# Included Dependencies

To get the ball rolling we include a few dependencies out of the box

- Compose
- Coroutines
- Flow
- Hilt
- ViewModels

# Attribution
The principles here for project structure follow the architectural patterns recommended by google in
their [Now in Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid/ "Now in Android") sample.
Additionally we follow learnings from [Jendrik Johannes](https://github.com/jjohannes "Jendrik Johannes") for modern Gradle conventions.
